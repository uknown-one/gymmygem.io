# Gymmygem

Gymmygem is a lightweight static site generator written in Ruby.  
It lets you create beautiful, multi-page websites from templates and content files with a single command.

## ✨ Features

- Simple CLI commands to generate and build websites
- Templating support with ERB
- Markdown content support
- Custom themes and layouts
- Zero external dependencies for deployment

## 📦 Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "gymmygem"
````

And then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install directly with:

```bash
gem install gymmygem
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Create a new site

```bash
gymmygem new mysite
```

This creates a folder structure:

    index.md
  templates/
    default.html.erb
```

### 2. Build your site

```bash
cd mysite
gymmygem build
